# .github
THE destination for amateur researchers with insatiable curiosity to present their work
## Introducing the Boundless Curiosity Open Research Project

The Boundless Curiosity Open Research Project is a non-profit initiative hosted on GitHub. It’s an open repository dedicated to amateur research across diverse fields—history, science, mathematics, music, and more. All information is freely available under the Unlicense, ensuring that anyone can use it for any purpose.

At the moment, I am the only contributor. But anyone can create their branches and forks and do whatevs with it, till I  figure out how to make some method of organizng repos etc. Till then let the chaos of AI assisted neo-enlightenment age thrive!!!

### Why Amateur Research?

Amateur researchers have historically played pivotal roles in advancing human knowledge. From William Herschel discovering Uranus with his homemade telescope to Benjamin Franklin pioneering electricity studies while working as a printer, amateurs have often been the unsung heroes of scientific revolutions. During the Age of Enlightenment, coffeehouses became hubs for intellectual discourse where curious minds—scientists and amateurs alike—debated ideas that shaped modern science[^2][^6][^9].

With today’s powerful AI tools like Perplexity and Google Deep Research, we aim to revive this spirit of amateur inquiry. Our goal is to empower thinkers, dreamers, and researchers from all walks of life to contribute to knowledge without institutional constraints.
